    <h3>Exercise</h3>
        <p>I enjoy exercising and strength-training at the gym. My favorite activities are weight-lifting and boxing.</p>

    <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>Naturally curious, I will likely be a life-long learner. I enjoy learning new topics and skills, as shown by my variety of associates degrees and licenses. Currently I am studying coding languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, and C++. I also enjoy listening to audio-books.</p>

    <h3>NFL Football</h3>
        <p>I love watching a good football game. Whether it's regular season, playoffs, Super Bowl, I will be watching.</p>

    <h3>Traveling</h3>
        <p>I love traveling and exploring new areas. Everywhere from the hot desert, to the rainy forest, to the rivers and lakes. Whenever I can be in nature, I happily accept the opportunity.</p>
